    <p>As of mid-April 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html">95%
    of the American population</a> are under orders to stay home. This new
    reality <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/video-conferencing-apps-surge-coronavirus/">has
    triggered a spike</a> in people accessing videoconferencing services. Zoom
    has received a significant amount of attention, but other major companies
    with competing services &mdash;Cisco, Google, and Microsoft&mdash; require
    similar scrutiny.</p><p>Consumers are caught in a difficult place. For
    millions of people, a videoconferencing service is the lifeline they need to
    stay employed, to access medical care, to keep in touch with family and
    friends. For many students &mdash; from pre-K through graduate school
    &mdash; videoconferencing, though not the only method of teaching
    interaction (e.g. one way video instruction or sending activities via
    email), is a central part of their education and connecting with classmates
    and teachers. If a person does not want to use a videoconferencing service
    out of privacy and security concerns, they may not be able to access
    classes, show up for a job, gain access to medical care or maintain contact
    with friends and family.</p><p>Consumers should be able to trust that
    companies will provide clear, simple language that shows how they respect
    and protect user privacy and security. There was an opportunity in the
    market for videoconferencing services to distinguish themselves as a leader
    in respecting user privacy as a core foundation of their business. Consumers
    deserve access to these services without sacrificing the privacy or security
    of their personal data and information.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered

    <p>Through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/skype-meet-webex-videoconference-privacy-845bc8360fd3">a
    comparative analysis</a>, we examined the privacy policies for three popular
    videoconference tools: Webex from Cisco, Skype from Microsoft, and Meet from
    Google. This comparative analysis was designed to identify potential risks
    and highlight areas where a lack of clarity creates doubt about how a
    company protects the privacy of its users. . This analysis does not imply
    every company is exploiting every possible loophole.&nbsp;</p><p>We
    conducted a comparative analysis on privacy policies since privacy policies
    create publicly defined commitments about a company&rsquo;s values. If
    something is true in the privacy policy, it should be true in the product,
    the user experience and the technical architecture behind the service. There
    are areas where the actual intentions of a company and their current daily
    practices are not accurately captured in their privacy policies.</p><p>The
    criteria used for these areas for improvement are <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/comparative-analysis-rubric-2d999ed0fa69">defined
    in this document</a>. For specific details on the services and a breakdown
    of these privacy policies, we created more granular overviews of <a

    href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/skype-teams-microsoft-policy-review-299bd1403c4b">Skype</a>,

    and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://medium.com/cr-digital-lab/webex-cisco-policy-review-3608a1eafddf">Webex</a>.
    These recommendations were framed in a way that is broadly applicable to any
    platform that offers video conferencing features.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Sent a letter to Company CEOs highlighting 10 recommendations and
    changes:</h2><p>Based on the analysis, our policy team reached out to
    Google, Cisco and Microsoft, gave them an opportunity to make needed
    improvements and sent a letter to the company CEOs. The goal of this work
    was to ensure that these services make clear, strong commitments in the
    privacy policies to protect people who use and rely on these services. The
    letter included recommendations covering the following
    topics:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Personal Data Leak.</li><li>First Party Data
    Collection.</li><li>Data Enhancement.</li><li>Third Party
    Access.</li><li>Implications of Employer or School Sponsorship of
    Service.</li><li>Data Deletion and Retention.</li><li>Differentiation
    Between Data Collected from Hosts Versus from
    Participants.</li><li>Information Used for Product Development.</li><li>Data
    that Can be Sold or Shared as Part of a Transaction.</li><li>Access to Data
    for Machine Learning, AI Analysis, or Human Review.</li></ol><h2>Consumer

    the key recommendations for users to stay more private in video chats
    including picking one platform, using outside privacy tools, assume
    you&rsquo;re being recorded and just make a regular phone
    call.</p><h2>Manufacturer engagement:&nbsp;</h2><p>In coordination with
    publishing the findings from the comparative analysis and sending a letter
    to the CEOs of Cisco, Google, and Microsoft, the Advocacy team also emailed
    contacts within each organization requesting a meeting to discuss the
    findings. We met with all three companies, with results summarized
    below.</p><ul><li>Cisco was the fastest to respond, and <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/video-conferencing-services/cisco-clarifies-privacy-policy-for-webex-videoconferencing/">made
    some changes</a> in short notice. These changes included adding clearer
    links to relevant policies from the sign up pages for WebEx, and providing a
    more accessible path to a document that provides greater detail about the
    data collection and use related to WebEx.</li><li>Initial meetings with both
    Microsoft and Google allowed both companies to get a clearer understanding
    of the areas for improvement that were outlined in the comparative analysis,
    but as of mid-June 2020, neither Google or Microsoft has followed up with
    details about actions or improvements they have taken in response to this
    work.</li></ul><h2>Press release:</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
