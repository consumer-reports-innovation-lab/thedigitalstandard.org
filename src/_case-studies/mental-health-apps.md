    <h2>Sensitive Data Collection</h2><p>Connected devices such as cameras are
    increasingly being used in the private sphere of the home and collect highly
    sensitive information including voice and visual recordings of the home and
    the area immediately around a private residence. However, as multiple
    reports of connected camera hacking and incidents of unauthorized access
    have shown, many of these products are built without adequate
    security.</p><h2>Exposure of account credentials</h2><p>There were a <a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ring-doorbells-had-vulnerability-leaking-wi-fi-login-info-researchers-found/">series
    of hacks </a>and vulnerabilities that have affected Ring security cameras
    and video doorbells, exposing account credentials. <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/video/terrifying-video-familys-hacked-ring-camera-system-67704081">Reports
    surfaced</a> of multiple Ring accounts being hacked through<a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-keep-dumping-ring-credentials-online-for-the-giggles/">
    credential stuffing</a>. Back in November 2019, <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ring-doorbells-had-vulnerability-leaking-wi-fi-login-info-researchers-found/">it
    was revealed</a> that Ring video doorbells contained a vulnerability that <a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/ring-patches-total-lack-of-password-security-during-setup/">exposed
    WiFi network names and passwords</a>. And last May, <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-latest-security-device-let-people-spy-on-you">The
    Information reported</a> a vulnerability that let individuals stay logged
    into Ring accounts even after a password change. At the end of December
    2019, it was also reported that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/tech/wyze-data-breach/index.html">Wyze
    had suffered a breach</a> of their customer data, leaving customers open to
    unauthorized access of their cameras.</p><h2>Security
    breaches:</h2><p>Attackers have openly viewed home security systems and baby
    monitor feeds, and have even spoken with residents, including young
    children. In December 2019, Consumer Reports reported on a <a
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/hacking/ring-doorbell-accounts-may-be-vulnerable-to-hackers/">series
    of security breaches</a>. The news mainly on Amazon Ring products, where
    hackers compromised devices, harassed homeowners and sometimes children.
    While much news coverage was focused on Ring, it was possible that other
    popular connected camera brands could have similar
    vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>These issues don&rsquo;t just plague Ring
    devices either. In January 2020, t<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/23/how-nest-designed-keep-intruders-out-peoples-homes-effectively-allowed-hackers-get/">here
    were reports of Nest cameras being hacked</a>, again through credential
    stuffing. In response to the number of hacks and vulnerabilities, Consumer
    Reports initiated product testing across 14 connected camera
    products.</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered from <a target="_blank"

    <h2>Full Testing</h2>
    <p>Across 14 home security connected cameras, Consumer
      Reports performed a round of full testing across these devices in accordance
      with criteria/indicators of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a>. The result
      of this testing was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/home-security-cameras-200099/wireless-security-cameras-200101/view2/">a
      set of Consumer Reports ratings</a> for home security cameras available to
      consumers (image left) which incorporated data privacy and security
      categories. Consumer Reports also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.consumerreports.org/wireless-security-cameras/wyze-and-guardzilla-home-security-cameras-have-security-risks/">reviewed
      cameras in 2019</a>.

    <h2>Created campaign strategy&nbsp;</h2><p>In order to organize our efforts,
    the Consumer Reports team strategized a campaign by doing research on
    reported hacking incidents in the month of December 2019, reviewed the IP
    camera testing report from August 2019 and assembled a list of company
    contacts at the 25 manufacturers of connected camera products we have
    reviewed.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wrote letter to manufacturers:</h2><p>In January
    2020, Consumer Reports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-urges-ring-wyze-guardzilla-and-others-to-raise-security-and-privacy-standards-for-connected-cameras/">drafted
    and sent letters to the 25 manufacturers</a> of connected cameras, smart
    doorbells, and DIY security products, since all of these products make use
    of cameras that collect sensitive information within and outside the home.
    &nbsp;These letters put the companies on notice that they must have
    reasonable cybersecurity measures in place in order for consumers to trust
    and use their products. Specifically, we <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=54328&amp;action=edit">stated</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;...Consumer
    Reports writes to urge your company to raise the standard of security for
    your connected camera, doorbell, or security system. We request
    clarification on the steps you are taking to prevent hacks and unauthorized
    access to these cameras and the systems that underlie them. We also want
    makers of connected devices to know that CR&rsquo;s ratings will continue to
    change to reflect the stronger data security and privacy practices we
    believe are essential for consumer protection, which could impact a
    product&rsquo;s eligibility for
    recommendation.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><h2>Identified 10 security
    measures</h2><p>The letters also urged the company to implement stronger
    security measures to adequately protect consumers and their privacy. These
    measures may include but are not limited to:</p><ol><li>Automatic
    firmware/software updates enabled by default;</li><li>Protection against
    credential stuffing and reuse;</li><li>Require multi-factor authentication
    and captchas in the authentication system;</li><li>Email notifications for
    users when a login occurs from a new device or a new IP
    address;&nbsp;</li><li>Require users to sign back in after changing a
    password;&nbsp;</li><li>Confirm with the user when the credentials have been
    changed;</li><li>Password creation rules that require more secure
    passwords;</li><li>Compatibility with password managers;</li><li>Increased
    protection against brute-force dictionary attacks by rate-limiting login
    attempts; and&nbsp;</li><li>Inclusion of a visible indicator (e.g., a
    prominent LED light) when cameras are active.</li></ol><h2>Engaged
    manufacturers with product improvements</h2><p>Of the 25 companies
    contacted, seven never responded to our letters or repeated emails, one
    responded by telling us about their privacy and security initiatives (but
    did not detail what security measures they implement or plan to implement),
    and one responded via a physical letter sent to our DC
    offices.</p><h2>Discovered vulnerabilities</h2><p>We tested these cameras in
    2019. From December 2019 - January 2020, we conducted a campaign to send out
    the letters to company CEOs, revisited our testing of the cameras, and then
    rescored them, which revealed new security vulnerabilities. We responsibly
    interacted with manufacturers to disclose these issues. Some of the results
    of the security and privacy tests resulted in an article: <a target="_blank"

    and Guardzilla Security Cameras Have Security Risks, Consumer Reports
    Finds</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Designed a Consumer Reports ratings page
    warning</h2><p>In order to publicize this effort, we posted a <a

    release</a>. In addition, we created a notice (image below) to place above
    our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/video-doorbells/ratings-overview/">ratings</a>
    pages to warn consumers about the security issues in these
    products.</p><h2>Offered other helpful resources: Article highlighting best
