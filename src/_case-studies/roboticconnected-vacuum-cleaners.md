<h2>Data sharing &amp; third parties:</h2><p>In an interview with Reuters
published in July 2017, iRobot CEO Colin Angle suggested his company might
one day share the mapping data collected by Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners
with tech companies such as Amazon, Google, or Apple. Within two years, he
explained, a detailed diagram of the floorplan in your home could be highly
valuable to such tech giants. Reuters subsequently corrected the article,
saying iRobot might share the data free of charge, not sell it.</p><h2>Data
collection:</h2><p>Several robotic vacuums come with smartphone apps. These
apps aren't necessary to operate the vacuums, but they&rsquo;re useful for
scheduling or remotely starting and stopping cleanings, checking a
robot&rsquo;s progress, or viewing maps of the vacuum&rsquo;s path around
your home to see whether it has missed any spots.</p><h2>Shifting
expectations for data sharing:</h2><p>Third party James Baussmann, the
company&rsquo;s public relations manager for North America, told CR that
iRobot won&rsquo;t be sending its data to third parties, at least for now.
&ldquo;iRobot believes that in the future, this information could provide
even more value for our customers by enabling the smart home and the devices
within it to work better, but always with their explicit
consent.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Vacuum data isn&rsquo;t the most sensitive
in the world,&rdquo; says Justin Brookman, CR&rsquo;s director of consumer
privacy and technology policy. &ldquo;These maps may be rudimentary now, but
it seems likely that they&rsquo;ll continue to improve over time in order to
more efficiently clean your home. It would be nice if these companies made
affirmative promises not to sell your information.&rdquo;</p><h2>Recording
paths in your home:</h2><p>iRobot is not alone. Many robotic-vacuum
manufacturers are now recording the paths of their appliances and uploading
them to a server. Consumers can then view that data via the company&rsquo;s
app on your smartphone.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered from <a
