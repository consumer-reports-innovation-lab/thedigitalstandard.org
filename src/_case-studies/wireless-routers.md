<p>Today&rsquo;s home network may include a wide range of wireless devices,
from computers and phones to IP Cameras, smart TVs, and connected
appliances. The router usually is the center of the home network. It&rsquo;s
a layer (even the only layer) that stays between your devices and the
internet. A secure router will help protect your devices &ndash; and your
information &ndash; from compromise. Therefore, the data privacy and
security of the router is an extremely important aspect to determine if a
router is good or bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer Reports has been publishing <a
href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/wireless-routers.htm">router
ratings</a> for years, but we've now made the tests tougher, screening for
approximately 60 different indicators of good security and privacy
practices, along with about 100 data points used to evaluate speed, ease of
use, and other characteristics.</p>

<p>The primary purpose is to investigate the most popular routers in the
data privacy and security aspect, to generate ratings for each router in
accordance with criteria/indicators of the <a
href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a>.
Specifically, we evaluate: 1. how easy the malicious person can compromise
data confidentiality, system integrity, and function availability; 2. how
well manufacture/service providers do in data collection, data retention,
data use, and data sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>We performed a full round of Digital
Standard testing on 38 wireless routers and it is now displayed on our site
on the <a
href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/wireless-routers/ratings-overview/">wireless
router ratings page</a>. The final ratings integrates data privacy and data
security into the overall rating. We reported the test result highlights in
this article here: <a

<h2>Consumer Reports Article:<strong> </strong></h2><p><a
href="https://www.consumerreports.org/wireless-routers/wireless-routers-lack-basic-security-protections/">Many
Wireless Routers Lack Basic Security Protections, Consumer Reports' Testing
Finds</a>. This article highlights new testing which shows the important
differences in how routers from popular brands handle digital security. It
covers how CR tests routers on a long list of characteristics. For instance,
we check whether a router protects against known security vulnerabilities
and whether certain questionable networking protocols are turned off by
default. We examine the routers&rsquo; privacy policies to see whether
manufacturers explain how they handle consumer data. Of course, we also
measure how quickly routers transmit data over a variety of distances. After
all, a safe and secure router won&rsquo;t do you much good if it&rsquo;s too
slow to reliably stream Netflix.&nbsp;</p><h3>Key security findings includes
topics on:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Protection against multiple failed login
attempts</li><li>Weaknesses in passwords</li><li>Networking protocols turned
on by default&nbsp;</li><li>How routers handled firmware updates, which are
vital for the home&rsquo;s network security</li><li>Router firmware
updates</li></ul><h3>Key privacy findings include topics
on:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Privacy policies and their mentions of what
manufacturers might collect from users such as network speeds, the name of
an internet service provider, and how much data people are transmitting to
the web.</li><li>Disabling features not inuse (e.g. Universal Plug and
Play)</li></ul>
