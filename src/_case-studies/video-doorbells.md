    <p>Video doorbells make it easy to see who&rsquo;s at your door, a
    convenience that provides a sense of security. But like any
    internet-connected security camera, they&rsquo;re also susceptible to
    hacking. So as part of Consumer Reports' ongoing efforts to protect
    consumers from hackers, we recently conducted data security and data privacy
    tests on the 24 video doorbells in our ratings, including five new
    models.</p><p>&ldquo;Often these cameras are pointing out into public
    spaces, but you still don't want to give hackers the ready ability to see
    who's coming and going from your house, and when,&rdquo; says Justin
    Brookman, director of privacy and technology policy for Consumer
    Reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer Reports&rsquo; Digital Lab evaluates digital
    products and services for how well they protect consumers&rsquo; data
    privacy and security. The most critical findings from our tests of video
    doorbells concern security vulnerabilities we discovered in five models from
    four brands that can expose user data like email addresses and account
    passwords. The brands
    are:</p><ul><li>Eufy</li><li>GoControl</li><li>LaView</li><li>Netvue</li></ul>

              <p>Our experts in the Digital Lab use <a
    href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">The Digital Standard</a>, an
    open-source set of criteria for evaluating digital products and services
    that CR created with other organizations, to conduct our security and
    privacy tests, scoring video doorbells on more than 70 indicators. Through
    these tests, our researchers created data privacy and data security ratings
    for each doorbell.</p><p>For data security, we use special tools to see if
    video doorbells have various security measures, such as encryption. We also
    look for, among other features, two-factor authentication, automatic
    software updates, and email notifications for when a user logs in from a new
    device or IP address.</p><p>For data privacy, we examine privacy setting
    options and publicly available documents, such as privacy policies and terms
    of service, to see how manufacturers collect and use your data, including
    whether they disclose how they collect your data and whom they share it
    with.</p><p>We also use more specialized techniques to look for potential
    security vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit to access the camera or
    personal data. &ldquo;Since these techniques may not be comparative from
    model to model, we don&rsquo;t incorporate it into our ratings,&rdquo; says
    Maria Rerecich, senior director of product testing at CR. &ldquo;But we do
    it so we can inform manufacturers of any issues we find and get them to
    improve the security of their products. Ultimately, our goal is to protect
    consumers from people who want to do them harm.&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a
    closer look at our findings. CR members can see the results of our
    performance tests, such as video quality and response time, in our <a

              <h2>Consumer Reports Article:</h2><p><a
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/video-doorbells/data-security-data-privacy-gaps-found-in-video-doorbells/"><em>Data
    Security and Privacy Gaps Found in Video Doorbells by Consumer Reports'
    Tests</em></a>. This article highlights that Consumer Reports&rsquo; tests
    revealed that most video doorbells lack <a
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-security/best-way-to-use-two-factor-authentication/">two-factor
    authentication</a>, a widely used security feature that sends users a
    temporary, onetime passcode typically via text message, email, phone, or
    mobile app to use in addition to their password for logging into their
    accounts. With this feature enabled, a hacker can&rsquo;t log in to your
    video doorbell account even if they have your password.</p><p>In fact,
    barely a quarter of the brands we tested have two-factor authentication. The
    only ones that have it are Arlo, August, Google Nest, Ring, and
    SimpliSafe.</p><p>In addition, many video doorbell manufacturers fail to
    minimize the amount of data they collect from users and don&rsquo;t offer
    consumers an easy way to request a copy of their data and/or delete
    it.</p><p>Key findings: Most video doorbells lack two-factor
    authentication</p><p>Only five of the 16 doorbell brands we tested offered
    two-factor authentication. They are Arlo, August, Google Nest, Ring, and
    SimpliSafe. They all encourage or require users to enable the feature,
    instead of burying it in the settings of the doorbell
    app.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2020. Multifactor authentication should really
    be standard on any security camera or video doorbell nowadays,&rdquo; says
    Brookman. &ldquo;It provides a basic layer of protection to help ensure that
    hackers can't access your camera feeds.&rdquo;</p><p>The doorbell brands
    that lacked this security feature at the time of our tests are Blue by ADT,
    Eufy, Geeni, GoControl, LaView, Maximus, Netvue, Night Owl, Remo+, Toucan,
    and Wisenet. Consumer Reports reached out to these 11 brands to see whether
    they plan to add the feature. We received responses from six
    companies:</p><ul><li>Blue by ADT says its doorbell will get the feature
    &ldquo;before the end of the year.&rdquo;</li><li>Eufy says it&rsquo;s
    starting to deploy two-factor authentication in the U.S. now.</li><li>Geeni
    says it will add the feature to its mobile app by Q4 2020.</li><li>Kuna says
    it plans to release two-factor authentication for the Maximus doorbell in
    early October.</li><li>Night Owl says it's going to release a new video
    doorbell in September that will offer two-factor authentication, but the
    feature will not come to existing doorbells.</li><li>Wisenet says it&rsquo;s
    in the early development stage for the feature and can&rsquo;t yet provide a
    timeline for its release.</li></ul><p>Two-factor authentication is a
    critical security feature that we look for in our data security tests, but
    it&rsquo;s not the only criteria we use in our evaluation. All the models
    met many other data security criteria, and as a result they all scored well.
    Two models, from Arlo and Google Nest, received an Excellent rating for data
    security, while 12 models received a Very Good rating. They include video
    doorbells made by August, Blue by ADT, Ring, SimpliSafe, Toucan, and
    Wisenet.</p><p>Over the past two years, Ring has made news due to <a
    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/hacking/ring-doorbell-accounts-may-be-vulnerable-to-hackers/">hacks
    of its doorbell and camera accounts</a>, <a
    href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-latest-security-device-let-people-spy-on-you">security
    vulnerabilities in its doorbells</a>, and <a
    href="https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/oversight-subcommittee-seeks-information-about-ring-s-agreements-with-police-and">scrutiny
    of its police partnerships</a>. But our tests, conducted from May to June,
    showed that the security of Ring devices was quite good.</p>
