  <h2>Context:</h2><p>Fertility or menstrual cycle trackers have been used by
  nearly a third of women in the U.S., according to a recent Kaiser Family
  Foundation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.kff.org/other/poll-finding/kff-health-apps-and-information-survey/">survey</a>.
  They are part of the burgeoning market for &ldquo;femtech,&rdquo; which are
  technology-based products and services focused on women&rsquo;s health. The
  market for all digital tools for women&rsquo;s health needs&mdash;such as
  apps for personalized nutrition advice, weight-loss coaching, and high-tech
  breast pumps that record when and how much is pumped&mdash;could be worth as
  much as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://ww2.frost.com/frost-perspectives/femtechtime-digital-revolution-womens-health-market/">$50
  billion by 2025</a>, according Frost &amp; Sullivan, a research and
  consulting firm.</p><h2>Sensitive data collection:</h2><p>Fertility or
  menstrual cycle trackers, broadly categorized as reproductive health
  &nbsp;trackers, can be used for a wide variety of reasons in addition to
  monitoring menstruation. Professional athletes, such as those on the U.S.
  women's soccer team and several British Olympic hockey gold medalists, use
  them to tailor workouts and nutrition plans to their body's cycles. Clue,
  Ovia, and Flo say that medical researchers use anonymized information from
  the apps to study women&rsquo;s health concerns. Some even have features
  that manufacturers claim will help diagnose medical conditions. Flo and Clue
  recently introduced tools to assess a user&rsquo;s risk of polycystic ovary
  syndrome (PCOS), a hormone disorder that can affect a woman's fertility.
  Period tracker apps are billed as useful tools for people who are trying to
  have a baby, want to prevent pregnancy, or need to monitor
  menstrual-cycle-related health problems such as hormone-triggered
  migraines.&nbsp;</p><h2>Personal information at risk:</h2><p>But to provide
  these services, the apps collect deeply personal information that can go
  well beyond the dates of your period. Depending on the app, that can include
  how often you engage in sexual activity, if you are trying to conceive, and
  whether you engage in unprotected sex, have experienced a miscarriage, or
  are approaching menopause.</p><h2>Data sharing to third parties and
  marketing:</h2><p>Consumer Reports&rsquo; Digital Lab found in a recent
  examination of five popular reproductive health tracking
  apps&mdash;BabyCenter, Clue, Flo, My Calendar, and Ovia&mdash;that even
  anonymous users have no guarantee that their information won&rsquo;t be
  shared in some way with third parties for marketing and other
  purposes.</p><p><em>[Excerpts gathered from <a target="_blank"

  <p>We conducted a comparative analysis of 5 reproductive health
  &nbsp;tracker apps: BabyCenter, Clue, Flo, My Calendar and Ovia. CR examined
  the apps and their privacy policies for clarity and comprehensiveness,
  authentication, customer service, data benefits, data privacy, security over
  time, governance, threat notifications and overall user
  experience.&nbsp;</p><p>To evaluate privacy practices and data security for
  BabyCenter, Clue, Flo, My Calendar, and Ovia, CR&rsquo;s Digital Lab used
  principles outlined in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard </a>in a
  comparative analysis. Launched by CR in 2017 in partnership with privacy and
  security experts, the standard is a set of benchmarks that companies can use
  to design digital products that are respectful of consumer privacy
  rights.</p>

  <p>The graphic scorecard illustrates some of the top categories to highlight
  throughout the experience.&nbsp;</p><h2><br />Findings reported in CR
  article:</h2><p>Consumer Reports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health-privacy/what-your-period-tracker-app-knows-about-you/">reported
  the findings through an article</a> that highlighted the apps are popular,
  but raises concerns about what happens to the very personal data they
  collect. None of the apps guarantee that all of your information will be
  used only in ways you intend. That&rsquo;s because they all share some user
  data with external partners for purposes such as targeted advertising. And
  those partners may then share or resell your personal information to third
  parties who make no promises to you about how they handle
  it.&nbsp;</p><h2><br />Letter to app companies:</h2><p>CR&rsquo;s Digital
  Lab also found shortcomings among all five apps in how they protect the
  sensitive user data they gather. The advocacy team <a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"
  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPezJ9AQXkecY1pQOO-_3FvDeAZFPkUm/view">wrote
  an email</a> that urged these apps to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Only use collected
  data for the purpose of the health app;</li><li>Limit the data you collect
  to only information needed to operate the app;</li><li>Decline to share or
  sell user information;</li><li>Safely destroy collected data once it is no
  longer needed to operate the app; and</li><li>Give consumers clear and
  concise information about what you do with their data and why.</li><li>When
  CR alerted the companies to these findings, some moved quickly to make
  fixes.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2><br />Flo app made changes:</h2><p>Flo dropped
  Facebook as an ad-tracking and data-analytics partner after <a
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636">The
  Wall Street Journal revealed</a>&nbsp;in February 2019 that the app shared
  personal data, such as whether a user intended to become pregnant, with the
  social media giant, which used the information for targeted advertising. Now
  Flo uses only one partner for ad targeting and app usage analysis while the
  other apps CR evaluated use a half-dozen or more.</p><h2>Identified
  shortcomings in data collection:</h2><p>While CR&rsquo;s Digital Lab
  didn&rsquo;t uncover any major security issues, it did find shortcomings in
  the way all five apps handle the sensitive user data they collect, says
  Maria Rerecich, CR&rsquo;s senior director of product testing. For example,
  none require users to log in by default every time they open the app, or
  offer multi-factor authentication (which requires that users input a code
  sent by text to their phone), or require an additional security step before
  accessing the app.&nbsp;</p>
