        procedure_html: >-
          <p>Browsers:</p><p>Identify publicly known vulnerabilities for each
          browser.</p><p>Use the original proof of concept code (if known) or
          devise custom code where necessary, to test the browser for the issue
          identified in the vulnerability notice.</p><p>Check if the browser is
          now protected from the identified
          vulnerabilities.</p><p>Apps:</p><p>Root/jailbreak the device,
